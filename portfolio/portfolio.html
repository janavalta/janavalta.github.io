She also notes two common forms of announcements on the pages: one being the site developer promising to update the page, and the second being an announcement that the page will no longer update or will move. I also found it compelling and agreed that websites can be “alive” despite not being up-to-date, and I think that is because of how the themed neighborhoods did a great job on emulating a real life neighborhood and community.</td>

It was interesting that Coklyat and Finnegan asked us to think of alt-text as poetry and translation, as I have never considered alt-text as another form of different media.

Nasser attempts to address this issue by creating a non-English programming language using Arabic. However, the effort cannot significantly change the industry since simply translating existing systems to accommodate other languages does not address the root issue of English's centrality in computer languages. Additionally, this solution places non-English languages as an afterthought in computer science.</td>

                            <td>"Art on the Internet" delves into how the Internet has changed art and its essence. Although I found parts of the essay difficult to follow, his discussion on the de-fictionalization and fictionalization of art was captivating. Groys argues that the Internet has shifted art towards a more interactive and communicative process, moving away from traditional object-based forms. He also explores the differences between art documentation in real life and its online presence, emphasizing how the creative process often happens in isolation. This explains why artists often prefer working in private spaces rather than in front of an audience. Furthermore, Groys raises an intriguing argument regarding the rejection of identification in this scenario, indicating an intricate relationship between artistic expression, digital representation, and hidden identity.</td>
